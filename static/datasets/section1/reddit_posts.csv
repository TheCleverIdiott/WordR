"I ordered a MacBook 2020 model around the 24th of May, and it was supposed to be delivered on the 25th of May, but Ekart being Ekart, is taking my MacBook on a musical chair game around the whole city. My package reached Uttarahalli, my locality, and then they shipped it to Dolamur hub, which is around 15kms away, for no reason. I have been in constant anxiety for over two days because of the transaction amount. I called customer care, but they are of no use. They say they have ""Forwarded the message to their backend team, and they are working on it at top priority"". I wanted to pick up the parcel myself from the closest hub, but there is no address available for these hubs. There is no way to contact Ekart Logistics Customer Care, and all of their numbers on Google are dead, and one of them transfers me to Flipkart Customer Care itself. I also asked the Flipkart cc to give me at least the customer care number of Ekart Logistics, but they say that they don't have their number. What is this bs, Ekart is acquired by Flipkart, and they only don't have their customer care numbers. How do they even contact them then?Flipkart customer care also said that they don't have information on the location of hubs, and they also don't have a policy where I can pick up the items directly from their hub.These are the screenshots from the Flipkart website - https://imgur.com/a/dkHvMbW.Edit - Twitter Post link: https://twitter.com/Tricksterrrr26/status/1530119888404381696Edit 2 - Thank you so much, guys. All of your comments are making me feel calmer.Edit 3 - It's out for delivery guys. I'll properly make the video for the unboxing of MacBook.https://preview.redd.it/1o2j26yok0291.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c60782ede9d9e662b6617dc214f5465ba642d3"
"why No DARK SKIN models on Flipkart, Amazon etc. ? though I'm a dark skin guy, its really tough for me to select clothes for myself as there are no models who match my complexion. Aren't they racist? and I think so."
"So I Ordered a Refurbished Pixel 3 from Flipkart Refurbished because it was advertised as 100% working and has gone through much testing and was said to be a Superb quality device. It was being sold through Flipkart assured by seller AHBGroups.The order came late than what was scheduled and upon opening found that the camera was not functioning properly, it was blurry and could not even scan QR codes. The front camera was also similar and also had a weird audible sound as if of a short circuit and hence I placed for a replacement.NOW BEGINS THE HORRORFlipkart refuses to acknowledge the replacement request and customer care asks to wait for 24hrs then 48hrs and then 72hrs. They have made me wait for a week without any progress in the replacement order. I feel this is a scam where they just sell you a defective device and waits till you finally give up because it is frustrating to deal with customer care who just exists for the sake of it. I've been directed to almost 10+ customer service guys who just repeat the same chat. I have tried Twitter handle to no avail and this has cost me days of productivity.Any advice on how to get a refund and be done with this?Also, I would not recommend anyone to buy Electronics from Flipkart again because if you get a defective product above a certain price, you are basically stuck with it!HELP!"

"Hey guys, are you aware that Flipkart is not delivering in most of pincodes in and around Hyderabad? 90% of the product/items are always not deliverable/out of stock since ~6 months. I have tried multiple pincodes of areas around Hyderabad with multiple products and it seems there is some issue going on with Flipkart logistics. I have found the same complaints by many people on internet. Is anyone aware of what actually the issue is? What's funny is, i have one of their final delivery station at a walkable distance near my house."

Posting this on behalf of my friend who was unable to post. Any help is appreciated:I ordered a macbook on Flipkart on 31st March. It gets delivered on 2nd of April but it was dead on arrival. It just did not start up. I lodged a complaint on Flipkart and they raised a replacement request. I was assured that they will replace the laptop. Their pickup guy comes on 4th April and he refused to replace the laptop saying that the laptop is not starting up. I was laughing at crying at the same time. I was like man that was the reason for replacing the laptop. I even went with him to the warehouse to talk with his senior since flipkart support was not picking up my calls. He started asking me for a jobsheet from Apple service center to process the replacement. I even went to the apple service center and got a jobsheet saying that the laptop has a faulty mother board. Now again the pickup came on 8th April and again refused to replace the laptop. Now this guy wants an engineer from Flipkart to verify and seal the laptop for him to replace it even after I showed him the jobsheet and as usual you cant contact flipkart support team when required. You have to wait for their callback and that always comes too late. When finally I got a callback from Flipkart the support exec said that the replacement request raised earlier was wrong and cancelled it. She promised that they will raise a new DOA replacement request once the cancellation request gets accepted. Now they are refusing to create it and are asking me to contact apple support. Apple Support has adamantly refused to replace the laptop since it was purchased from Flipkart but they are ready to fix it (Last Option for me). Now these asshole flipkart support are disconnecting my calls in the middle and acting like they are not able to hear me. Flipkart completely played me this time. I have even tried twitter and their support team in twitter is also absolute shit and are just sending me automated tweets that someone is looking into it and blah blah blah. This is the tweet. Please retweet if possible so that they atleast take some notice of this.  https://twitter.com/sibasish247/status/1512306084207161349?s=20&t=zIV64EzA2ikFUvSx3UTKBw Now the only options left with me is either to pursue this matter legally or get the laptop repaired. I dont have much experience in these legal matters so I am going to do some research on it. I feel hopeless now. I should have done some research before purchasing from there. Flipkart is just playing with their customers and dont give a flying fuck to them. Thanks in advance!!! Any help on this is appreciated. P.S - This is my first post in reddit. Sorry if it looks amateur.

"Girlfriend needed a new laptop so we saved for a few months and spent 65K on a Lenovo from Flipkart on 8 March 2022. Gets delivered on 10 March 2022 by this rough sounding asshole of a guy who's says ""aap check nahi kar sakte ho, OTP dedo, ye sirf itna dekhne ke liye hai ki laptop bahar se damaged hai ki nahi"". I still try checking if everything is Ok with the delivered product but you can't do a meaniful check in 2 mins with a dick looming give feet from your face. Within the hour, we realize letters on the keyboard don't register every keypress. That's when this nightmare starts. I register a complaint but i can only ask for a replacement, not a refund. There's just no option. So i ask for a replacement, but then for some reason, i have to wait until the 24th of March - almost the rest of the month - to hopefully receive a replacement so she can use something she's paid hard earned money for. But we don't have a choice. I keep getting told over the next few days that Lenovo's agen will come, and that they will replace once he gives them the OK. No one from Lenovo calls. No update happens. Eventually, on 14 March 2022, i register a consumer complaint, which is the only reason i feel they call me, cancel the tech visit and order a replacement.I'm at this point thinking, thank God. I'm done, I'll get a new one. Today, it said out for delivery. Guess what? That same goddamn asshole who first gave me the dud calls me and says ""aapne damage ka claim diya hai, defect ka nahi toh main replace nahi karunga"". Eventually i get a text saying ""delivery failed: could not check corresponding item to be picked up"" WHEN THAT GUY DIDNT EVEN SHOW UP TO MY HOUSE TO CHECKI try contacting Flipkart but their fucking chatbot auto voice bot greets me. I request calls which don't come. Eventually when someone calls and i ask them to put me thru to a senior exec who can actually do something about this, they tell me they will but INVARIABLY hang up while I'm waiting, needing me to go to their autovoice helpline thing again.At this point, i think I'll try Twitter. Maybe that will help. So i tweet. Nothing happens. No one responds after the standard ""pLeAsE dM uS"". No one responds to my DM. Nothing.I get a call after a few hours, when I have resigned myself to having to file a SCDRC complaint. Which i will do. I've done several NCDRC matters as a Litigation Associate in my day job. So i will drag these assholes through Consumer Court for putting me through what they've put me through, because i have to deal with deadlines for the actual day job that I have, and instead here I am talking to Flipkart fucking auto voice assistant.You know what struck me as the oddest thing about this entire horrible ordeal? The government consumer helpline. They're 300x more courteous and easy to reach than ShitKart's ""customer service"".Fuck Flipkart and fuck me for trusting them with my money.Tweet, please amplify if possible: https://twitter.com/qhcl0/status/1506222809407963141?t=JDuHw0BYB7saXMy4joPhgA&s=19UPDATE 1: I received a call from sincere sounding lady from FK a few minutes ago, at 10am. She asked me if the delivery guy ever showed up at my house, i told her he did not. She said she had spoken to the guy before calling me and he'd apparently been vague. That guy does not know I have a recorded crystal clear clip of my call with him. The lady says she will personally follow up and figure this out, and to expect a call back today itself. That she's been through my case etc , none of the same stuff I've heard from half assed customer service execs over the past weeks. JUST BECAUSE I PUT THIS UP ON REDDIT/TWITTER. Which means if this hadn't blown up, they wouldn't have given a fuck. I would have been at the mercy of a random guy's executive, on the spot decision about whether I should get a replacement for a DOA laptop HE HIMSELF GAVE ME.Edit to Update 1: A really nice FK employee also raised an internal complaint last night (and commented on this thread) so I'm sure that helped too. Didn't want to tag/spam him but I sure as hell am grateful.Adding some useful details that might help if you're in a situation similar to mine:NCH - The National Consumer Helpline - 1800114000 or 14404My experience has been good with the NCH. They're courteous and helpful. Once you're through the process and have no resolution, they will guide you with next steps, i.e., approaching the District/State/National Consumer Commission.2) FlipKart's Grievance Officer: Someone reached out with their details stating that emailing them will help -FLIPKART GRIEVANCE OFFICER DETAILS :- EMAIL : grievance.officer@flipkart.com CONTACT : 1800 202 9898 [MON - SAT : 9AM - 6PM]I have not yet approached them, but will once I have time from work and update with my experience with them.Update 2 (6:15pm 23 March 2022) : Same lady who called me up in the morning called me back. She said that the replacement product (that the delivery guy refused to deliver) cannot be delivered to me due to some ""technical issues"", and that a new product will now be shipped. At this point, I'm thinking she's having a laugh but nope, she's serious. I ask her what's the time line gonna be like on this? She has no idea. Once the product ships, only then she will know. So I ask if she can give me a refund and get me out of this hellhole. She says she can speak to the seller. Lol, never ending nightmare. Speaking to her again tomorrow."

"Here is the first part:  (7) Flipkart might be one of the worst places to buy electronic good from and I feel harassed. : IndianGaming (reddit.com)So, after 7-8 more calls with the customercare executives, they again agreed to send a ""technician"". The technician phoned me yesterday and I instantly recognized it was the guy from the first visit. He asked me my address and immediately hung up. After 2-3 hours I received a message from flipkart claiming that the technician wasn't able to reach me, receiving this I called him back and naturally, he didn't pick up. Again, I called flipkart to ask them to send me a different technician but they insisted they cannot do such a thing and now that the return window is over I can't even request a return.The thing that I didn't mention last time was that it was the first thing I bought with my own pay cheque, and this is the experience I have to face. I would just request you guys to never buy things from this website, they don't value their customers and don't have any work ethic. I will be taking this crap to the service center but I want the guys at flipkart to pay for this harassment, can anyone suggest me something?"
"I am posting this as my experience and any additional help would be really appreciated.So, I bought a Realme 9i on the 13th of May, 2022 and was delivered on 15th of May. I set up the phone and found that the fingerprint sensor wasn't working properly, it unlocked the phone 3/10 times, the UI and the overall experience seemed sluggish and the battery, which is of 5000 Mah, lasted for half a day. I am not a heavy user, for comparison my 3 year old nokia 6.1 plus with 3000 Mah battery stills lasts an entire day. After using it for a day, I naturally issued a replacement. This is where everything started to fall apart, the guy which is a so called ""representative"" showed up and ""taught"" me how the given sensor is ""touch and press down"" sensor instead of a touch one, furthermore he didn't even check anything, just installed an app which checks the fingerprint sensor and reported back that the phone is in ""good"" condition. Now, I am stuck with a phone which is deteriorating, taking almost 20 seconds to open whatsapp and sometimes even crashing and not even detecting my touch in chrome.Needless to say I'm extremely annoyed by the condescending nature of the representative who barely even knew where the sensor was and the flipkart customer service is a nightmare. I called them 5 times today and they did nothing-most of the time they just put my call on hold and forgot that I even exist. I feel harassed, cheated and I feel as if they don't even care about their customers. I think I will upload this fiasco to consumer forum and HOPE I get a replacement. Any additional help will be appreciated.Here is a video for reference:https://imgur.com/a/74sPG0LP.S: Fixed the date from March to May. I was tired yesterday with the shit their customer service put me through.Update: Upon some of your's advices, I posted on twitter and consumer forum. Although this is not a solution but I did recieve some updates from Twitter and consumer forum. The Twitter guys asked me to DM me, but provided me with super generic replies and the Consumer forum updated with the comment that they are looking into this matter. Nobody confirmed a return nor did anyone reach me via phone or email."
"Ordered some products from Flipkart. Nothing much, just some candies and other stuff. Worth about ₹500.Delivery agent called me 3 days later to confirm my address, told me he’d call me when he gets here. Didn’t receive any call till evening, so I checked the app to see whether they’ve postponed the delivery. To my surprise, the app said it has been delivered. I immediately tried to call the delivery agent. I dialled the ekart number and entered the pin code shown in the order page(which was still visible at the time). The guy who answered asked for my name and told me he never had any orders for me, and definitely didn’t call me earlier.Now I was confused, so I requested a call back from the order page, and got one soon. They told me the item isn’t delivered according to their records, so wait for another day. And I did. But still no product. So I called them again on the next day. Now this time, they told me it has been delivered and I told them they’re wrong. Their response was “I understand your inconvenience, and I’m sorry for this”, a sentence that I’d soon get sick of. They told me the issue will be resolved in one week, to which I replied I don’t need the product after a couple of days, so if that’s the best they could do, just cancel my order and refund my money. Apparently, they can’t do that. So I waited.After that, I received 3-4 separate calls from Flipkart, with recorded messages saying different items in the order has been delivered. Each time when they asked me to confirm, I dialled the number corresponding to “I haven’t even seen the damn thing”, and immediately afterwards asked for a callback from a human being, to ask why am I getting these phone calls. Each time, they understood my inconvenience and were sorry for it. Some of them “noted” my issue, one of them “escalated” it and another one “prioritised” it considering I’m a repeat caller, but none of them could find the product or refund my money.So the promised resolution day finally arrived and I received another phone call from Flipkart. Of course, if they had found the product or had refunded my money, I wouldn’t be writing this post, would I? So no surprises there. Just another gentleman who understood my inconvenience and was sorry for it. He wanted another business day to resolve the issue. I had had enough. So I told him he can’t have one day, and I want my money back. Again, he didn’t have an option for that, because the courier provider was saying they’ve delivered it.During all these calls, they kept referring to this courier provider, who is responsible for all this, and that they haven’t got any response from the courier provider. The courier provider is ekart logistics, a subsidiary of Flipkart. So I asked him why is this taking so long when the courier provider is also an entity under Flipkart. He understood my inconvenience and was sorry for it.Anyway, he then promised me that I’d have a resolution on the promised day itself, and I can expect a call by the end of the day, which of course, didn’t happen.So the next day, I requested a call back again. Got one, confirmed my name, confirmed that it was the right time to talk, confirmed the products in my order, and how it has not been delivered yet. I must have said my story at least 6-7 times during this period, and they told me I’d have a resolution by 11.30. Now this was the promised+1 th day, which was already unacceptable and they wanted me to wait even more. I told them to cancel my order and return my money. They told me they can’t because it’s marked delivered. So, someone employed by ekart, which is owned by Flipkart, made a mistake, and now my money is gone and Flipkart can’t even admit it’s their failt? I asked them that, but a curious thing happened. No response. It wasn’t any network issues, I could hear the background noise from their office, and they weren’t asking me to speak up or anything, so I guess they could hear me as well. Just no response from their end. I thought they were AFK or just playing possum. Waited a couple of minutes, and they said hello to which I replied and they hung up on me. I waited some time, just to see whether I’d get another callback, since this one ended in such a strange fashion.So I called again, this time asking for someone who actually has some power. I got disconnected again, but this guy, called me back, and then transferred me to someone above him. Apparently, they can do both of those. Who knew!But then things got weird again. This lady was speaking in Hindi, even though the first guy was speaking in English and my request was for a call in English. I told her I don’t understand what she was saying. She apologised, switched to English and I got disconnected again.So, I requested a 3rd call. On the same day. Now with this one, I didn’t wait for her questions, just stated my entire history, and then told her she can’t solve my problem, and there’s no reason for her to waste her time listening to a frustrated customer, if she can’t solve the issues. I was told no one who could do something like that was available at that time. So I I told her to make one of them call me when they’re free, since there’s no way I can call any of them directly. Guess what? They can’t do that either. The only way to get in touch with this mysterious higher up, is to open the app, request for a call back, explain your story to the customer care exec, wait while they check your details and complaints, and hope they’re free at the time. If they’re not, just repeat the whole damn process. No appointments, no call backs, no calls.Once again, I had had enough I want a resolution now. So she told me to wait for half an hour. I was on the phone for longer than that, so there was no way I was gonna wait. All of a sudden, a higher executive became available, and after being on hold for 10 minutes(in my mind I imagine them betting on how long I’d wait), I got connected.Finally, some answers. Except they were the same ones I already knew. I was at my limit. Still, I didn’t raise my voice, just told her about everything that has already happened and she told me that there will be a resolution by 7 PM. This time, I took a different route. I asked her what would happen if nothing happens by that time.“Your problem would be escalated to the team head(that’s what it sounded like)”“Then why wasn’t my problem already escalated to the team head when you couldn’t find a solution on the original promised day?”“The promised day was moved to today, that’s why it wasn’t already escalated”“So, what’s stopping you from moving it again if you couldn’t find a solution by 7 PM?”“The promised day won’t be moved again sir”“It has already been moved”“It won’t be moved more than once sir”Yeah. That makes sense. But having no other option, I waited.After that I told her their system of callbacks were not working for me. I wanted to get in touch with this lady, since she’s the one who promised me a resolution by the end of the day, and I didn’t want to tell the whole story to someone else, again. Of course, there’s no way to do that. So I asked her to call me at 7 PM with their decision. Aaaand, they can’t do that. I told her this system serves no purpose other than making sure no customer can get in touch with them, and my call was disconnected. No callbacks. Once again, left with no other option, I waited.7 PM : No prizes for guessing what happened. Nothing happened. I requested a call back again. And again someone understood my concerns, and was sorry for the inconvenience. Again, I was on hold.And after those tense moments filled with anticipation, I was asked to wait another 24 hours. The promised day wasn’t moved. I just had to wait 24 hours from 8 PM of the promised day. You can’t make this shit up. I asked him to transfer me to their “escalation team”. I was again on hold, after 5 minutes, I got disconnected.So I again requested a callback. Funnily enough, I believe I got the first person who answered my call 1 week back. I was completing the full circle. I regretted not taking note of everyone I talked with over this one week. Anyway, after going through the routine, I was on hold again waiting for someone from escalation team. Aaaand the phone got disconnected. No callbacks as usual.So I again requested a callback. Same routine, on hold again. Still on hold in fact. I started typing this when I was on hold during the first call today. I don’t know where this adventure is gonna take me, but I’m fully invested now. I will get my ₹500 back.TBC…."
Are refurbished phones on Flipkart a good deal or a scam?
"Govt gears up to take on Flipkart, Amazon"
So I was excited to order my first ever console. And by mistake I went with flipkart. I placed my order on 19th may and depends date was of 4th june ( as it was a pre order)So I waited enough already and all this excitement went to vain so quickly. My product never shipped from flipkart. They kept on delaying the dates. And provided no update on what’s happening. Customer care kept on saying “backend team” connects with the seller and they know what’s happening and they will connect with you.And plot twist was they never connect with me. They used to send texts/mails and used to say unable to connect with me. Even after providing them a certain time for a call. Guess what? They never called. On top of it they always mark the issues raised by me as “resolved” by providing no option.During all this mess up flipkart was not letting me cancel my order as well. I went on to miss price drop on Amazon during this time. Then automatically today they canceled my order and again it’s not that easy. App is not showing it as canceled. And again I have to put efforts to get my refund. This has been such a hell experience.Just writing this If someone doesn’t mind spending 1-2k price difference and order from some other platform then go for it.
"Recently, I got a job so thought I’d gift my mom a phone from my first salary. Should’ve just got it from Amazon. Since Motorola sells it only on Flipkart. I ordered a Moto E40 on Flipkart on 4th April. It gets delivered on 7th of April but the phone speaker was faulty (Lot of vibrations and screechy noise). Since it had a 7 days replacement with the order. I raised the complaint on Flipkart on the same day regarding the issue, Flipkart being Flipkart you cannot call them, I have to request a call back and they will call you and its always very late. The Flipkart Service team are some of the laziest guys ever, they enquire about my order ask what is the problem put me hold for 10-15min and just abruptly cut the call.Day 2 : I’m still calling Flipkart and them putting me on hold and just cutting the call.Day 3 : Finally one lady doesn’t cut the call tells me I have to call the Motorola service guys and raise the issue with them and they will solve my issue, First they gave me a spam number and finally got hold of Motorola CC number.DAY 4 : I call the Motorola guys they take all my order details again and say they have raised a ticket and will call me back in 24-48 hrs.Day 5 : No call from them, Thought I’d call them, But their CC service number closes at 5.30.Day 6 : I finally get a call back from Motorola and they tell me they have understand/considered my concern and Guess what they tell me to call the Flipkart again saying that they cannot start the replacement process. Then same story continues again with Flipkart, after they cut 2-3 calls from me, Finally someone picked up and explained her everything about my order and all the troubleshooting the phone etc, she raised a replacement request, and told me the replacement will be delivered by 19th April.Day 7:  I thought I was done with this whole fiasco. Today the technician came to check the faulty speaker I explained and showed it him, He did all his testing and found the problem and told he will approve the replacement and he will initiate the process from his side.After some 30 min since he left, I get a message that the replacement is cancelled.Now, I’m waiting for their call back and that always comes too late.  And they already cut my call after putting it on hold for 2 times today.Flipkart straight up just scammed me, They are delaying to do the replacement to lapse their 7 day policy. Lost my total peace of mind and gone mental this past week. Since I the replacement gets expired today. I’ll be stuck with this faulty phone or else get it repaired elsewhere. I’m seeing this happen to lots of people too, even Geeky Ranjit made a video on them last week, I wish I’d seen that before ordering. Flipkart is just playing with their customers and THEY JUST SIMPLY DON’T CARE. It’s just so tiring. Amazon is 10x better with their service. If anyone is thinking to buy from Flipkart, PLEASE DON’T. Even if Amazon has the same product with 5-10% costlier its better to pay that than to deal with Flipkart.Any help on this is appreciated.END OF RANTTldr: Got delivered a faulty phone from Flipkart and their shitty CC Team are delaying the process so that it lapses their 7 day replacement policy.Edit : Made a tweet now https://twitter.com/tezaaf1/status/1514604696073535494?t=DvCUBxp4dmpVgXHiOUxElQ&s=19"

"I wanted a mobile sleeve (yes, I’m one of “those people” … lol). I saw one on Flipkart, ordered it. It was a combo: a neoprene sleeve and a 3.5 mm jack splitter. The item arrived, except, instead of the sleeve, there was some white pouch with a sticky back (probably to stick behind the phone?).I placed a return request. Flipkart accepted it. The delivery person comes, sees the product and says, ‘Well, this is different from what’s shown in the image.’‘Yup, hence I’m returning it.’‘No, I mean I can’t take this. My org is going to reject it saying this is different from the website description.’‘But I’m returning it because what I got is different from the website description!’‘No, you’d better contact customer care and get this sorted. I cannot take this now. It’ll get rejected.’I call the customer care (after some three or four sessions with their “smart” chat assistant. The rep says the returns person is supposed to pick it up. Asks me to tell him that I spoke to customer care.The man returns. I tell him this. He takes the product under the condition that it may be rejected. I have no choice. I give it to him. He says the money will be cut from his salary if it gets rejected.He calls me back tonight and says his organisation isn’t accepting the return.It’s a tricky situation I’m in. I’m returning the product because it doesn’t match the description. And the return is getting rejected because it’s different from ye website description.Any idea how to handle this?"

"Since when flipkart is doing this? Had ordered Soundcore Q35 with product exchange option and selected my redmi note 3 for exchange. It wasn't mentioned that, original box & charger would be needed for exchange while placing the order. Kindly rectify if I’m wrong. So I would like to ask, if anyone recently exchanged with flipkart, where it was mentioned they’re both needed alongside the phone and since when this is the policy as earlier it didn’t use to happen?Delivery agent told both are required. I didn't find it’s original box since it's an old product, I tried calling the customer service who also said the same, both will be required for exchange otherwise my order will be cancelled. I'm not finding it's mentioned anywhere saying that. Let me know your recent experience if anyone has gone through similar. Have tweeted & DM'd to @flipkartsupportLet me know what should I do or should I just cancel the order as don't wanna pay extra for ""without exchange"" option, also the selling phone in a day isn't possible.Would appreciate if any popular twitter users, lurking over here can retweet my tweets. Will DM the tweets, feel free to ping.Really needed a headphone as my audio technica m30x got broken."

"TLDR: Ordered a gaming laptop from Flipkart, Flipkart cancelled it aftee delaying for many days. Ordered the same from Amazon at a little higher price, got a defective product. Amazon didn't deliver the product after delivery guy made different excuses on 3 different delivery/exchange dates and then returned it to seller.First of all I am not an active user here. Didn't know with who else to share my experience.Warning: Very Long PostPart 1I ordered MSI Bravo 15 Ryzen 5 from Flipkart on March 15. It was supposed to be delivered on 16th. The product didn't even ship by 16th EOD. Contacted Flipkart and they didn't do anything on 16th saying I should wait by end of day. On 17th morning the status changed to that it will be delivered between 16-18th. 18th was Holi so it was never gonna arrive that day. Fast forward to 18th, product still isn't shipped. Requested a call back from Flipkart on 18th evening. Just got a call from Flipkart without a single sound from the other end. Call lasted 20 minutes.Got a message from Flipkart on 19th morning that shipper has cancelled the order and they didn't want to keep me waiting( I haven't seen a more ironical statement). But the status on the app was still ""To be delivered between 16th and 18th"". Finally got a real call back from Flipkart on 19th which was followed by multiple calls(3 to 4) from Flipkart after ranting on twitter. I was told that the order is still not canceled and it will be delivered. The first lady who called said that its due to a glitch that the status hasn't changed on the app). Needless to say nothing happened even the next day and I cancelled my order. But it was gonna take 3 to 5 days to get refund. This is why I didn't cancel on the second day itself.Guys never order anything expensive using Debit card. Always use UPI or credit card.I also raised a complaint on national consumer helpline. They are completely useless. Only thing they do is contact Flipkart and tell them what I told them. And then they said that Flipkart is doing the refund. If you need more help go to an offline consumer court.Part 2As I got the refund I ordered the same laptop from Amazon for 3500 rs more. I also contacted all the official stores in Delhi NCR, none of them had that laptop). You always hear that Amazon have a better customer service than Flipkart. Well jumping from a 100m building is certainly better than jumping from a 105m tall building.I tried to pay using UPI but wasn't able to as I exhausted the upi limit for that day. So I decided to pay using Debit Card(Why the fuck did I trust Amazon). The payment was made the order status was still payment pending. I talked to Amazon's customer support(They are certainly more reachable than Flipkart). They said the order status is confirmed and the same would reflect on their app in a few hours). It was night so when I woke up the next day order was canceled and refund will he made in 3 to 5 days. I contacted Amazon customer support. Shouted at them but nothing was going to change ofcourse. Actually got the refund in 3 working days this time (took 5 from Flipkart).Part 3So then I ordered the same from Amazon using UPI this time on 29th. It was supposed to be delivered by 2nd but it was delivered on 1st itself.2 days later I found out that 1 pixel on the display was dead. It was always green. I ordered a replacement from Amazon on 3rd it was supposed to be delivered by 7th. The pickup and delivery was supposed to be made at the same time. Now the drama and suffering starts.It was out for delivery on 7th morning. At 6PM I got an SMS that driver tried to contact me but couldn't. I received no calls, my phone was active. No one rang the ball. I contacted Amazon and told them what happened. They asked for an alternate mobile number and said that the delivery will be attempted today again. It was not attempted. I went to twitter to complaint about it. They aranged a chat with social media team who asked for 3 working days tk sort this out(Turns out they are worse than the regular customer service). I was going out of town on 8th so I rescheduled it for 9th April.Comes 9th april, status didn't change till evening. It didn't go out for delivery by evening. Contacted amazon and they said it will be delivered by next day for sure. Since I ordered a reschedule, replacements take one day more than what is listed(fucking liars).Comes 10th, it didn't go out for delivery till 3 PM. Contacted amazon and they said they will try to send it the same day itself. To my surprise it actually did go out for delivery near 5PM. It got late about 9PM but it was still not delivered. I called the delivery agent multiple times but he rejected the call. At 10:35 I received a call from the delivery agent which rang for a total of no more than 3 seconds. The phone was in my hand and I couldn't pick it up as he cut the call. Few minutes later I receive a status on Amazon app as, action required by you, delivery agent couldn't locate my address.  I have ordered 100s of items at the same address. The fuckers at Amazon actually believe that shit. They confirmed my address again and asked for an alternate mobile number.Next day(today) it goes out for delivery right in the morning. The agent didn't pick up the call till afternoon. I was not at home so didn't call too many times. Contacted amazon and told them I have still not received it. They asked me to call the agent again, I did and he actually picked up. He said that I don't have the product, some one else might have it and cut the call. Told the same to amazon customer support. They said he has the product, I am contacting delivery station and I'll get the product today itself.At about 10:20 the status changed to Item returning to Seller. I rage call Amazon CS, that fucker was a clown. He said all they could do now is arrange pick up which will take place on Thursday. And after it reaches the seller I will get the refund in 2-3 days. He didn't answer any of my questions like what did they talk to the delivery station about. He said that there is no way for them to talk to the delivery agent, they can only talk to delivery station. I don't know what the fuck they talked to him and allowed such behavior.I told if you can arrange a pickup why the hell can't you deliver it if the problem is with the address or unable to contact than how are these problems gonna magically go away. He said replacement is done only once and now only pickup for return can be made. I asked him how is it my fault for you not delivering it. He ignored me and said is there anything else I can help you with.Fuck Amazon man, in the end all I could do is return and wait like an idiot for like 5 more days to get my money back. I don't see any legal options as well.Fuck Amazon, Fuck Flipkart and Fuck National Consumer Helpline"
"Hello I want to buy a glorious model o wireless mouse black,but it's only available at flipkart.The seller has no ratings at all and seeing recent post of people getting scammed from Flipkart I am bit skeptical to order from them.https://dl.flipkart.com/s/c62IG3NNNNShould I order or don't take the risk?"
"I bought an appliance which was broken when delivered to me.  I clicked photos and uploaded them following the return request.It has been three days and the request is still pending. The return request should have been approved on 14th June but it hasn't moved any further, even image verification has not been processed yet.Talked with customer support, tweeted about it and all they are saying since last three days is that I should contact them after 24 hours as they are unable to proceed with the image verification.Could you please help me how I should go ahead as it is getting on my nerves, all these talking and waiting daily for 24 hours is just becoming unbearable.Thanks in advance."
I have ordered a 1TB SSD version of legion 5 from Flipkart. But it is showing I have 2Tb SSD???
"I recently ordered acer 27 XV272U from flipkart, It was a horrible experience. I bought the monitor for 22999 rupees (300$) from flipkart and it was opened previously.My 2 cents on the monitor and the service offered by Flipkart:The monitor is fantastic I have read about a bunch of comments that the HDR is very bad, but I have been using HDR in windows and in games it seems to be working fine and looks gorgeous. Max brightness is 445 nits , you wont get the best HDR at that brightness.The colors are good luckily there is no ghosting on my panel.The refresh rate is awesome 144HZ but you will only get 8bit colors at that rate , for 10bit you need to tone down to 120HZ and moreover 10bit works only on display port not on HDMI port.The best part was the stand ,it is pure metal and is very very sturdy.The panel is big (27 inches), you can adjust height, rotation and swivel.Do remember that the freesync range is 48-144hz which is unfortunate because LG ultragear for 5000 (70$) more will provide you gsync whose range is 30-144hz.7.The monitor has 2USB 3.0 ports which is a great help, I have been using these from time to time.8.In india it is the cheapest monitor which will provide you with almost all the features.9.One strange thing I noticed was that when I used it as a secondary monitor for my work its whites were a little yellowish and when I tested its colors as a primary monitor the colors were fine . I will have to test a little bit more in this area otherwise the monitor is just awesome.10. The power cable which they have provided for the monitor is for a bigger socket (16 amps) like provided for oven  or washing machines, so you might have to buy a smaller one for traditional sockets.On flipkart:1.I have lost my trust from flipkart and its sellers .There is absolutely no quality control from the flipkart side ,the above monitor which I ordered was already used before and I was getting broken thermocol pieces inside the box, I will be attaching a video link of my complete unboxing video.2.I recommend people not to order items from flipkart make your first priority as amazon which is much much better. Better buy Acer nitro VG271U 27 from amazon as the XV272U is very costly there ,it has the same panel it is 1000 (15$) less and buy a vesa mount for that remaining money.Video link: https://www.reddit.com/user/Pitiful-Race7267/comments/v9qmo0/acer_vx272u_from_flipkart_unboxing_video/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"

"Every year, I read news pieces saying that flipkart.com registered losses(albeit increased revenue). Do these eCommerce giants have a profitable business model? Based on the economics book I am reading. Amazon retail does not make much profit, and all of Amazon's profitability comes from AWS and Prime. If Amazon retail can't turn a profit, what chances does flipkart have? or Am I misunderstanding something?Snapdeal famously crashed and burned, IIRC."
"Hey,I just ordered my first manga (chainsaw man vol 1 and 2) from bookswagon. I then noticed that it's cheaper by 100 bucks if i buy from Flipkart. I also noticed that a lot of comments in Flipkart say the book quality is poor. Does that mean that the manga was a knockoff ?How was your experience with flipkart compared to bookswagon?Thanks"
Does Flipkart deliver to vallalar? How many time do they take normally?
